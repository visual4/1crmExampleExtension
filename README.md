# 1crm Example Extension
This Project aims to show how to change basic functionality in 1CRM from an extension.
It is meant for learning different methods of extending the 1CRM core in an upgrade safe manner.

to keep it simple and understandable, every single example has it's own branch. The master branch contains the common files and structure that are required to install the extension.
